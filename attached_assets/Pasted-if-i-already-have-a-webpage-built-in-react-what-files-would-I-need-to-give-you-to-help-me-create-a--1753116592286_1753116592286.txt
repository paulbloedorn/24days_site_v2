if i already have a webpage built in react, what files would I need to give you to help me create a proper tina/config.ts file?

If you already have a React-based website and want help creating a proper tina/config.ts file for TinaCMS (TinaCloud), here's what I'd need from you to do it well:

📁 Key Files to Share
1. Content Files (if any)
Markdown (.md), MDX, JSON, or YAML files — whatever you're using to store content.

Usually found in a content/, data/, or pages/ folder.

Why: Tina uses these as the source of truth for content editing.

2. Homepage Component (Home.tsx, Home.jsx, or similar)
The actual React component that renders the homepage.

Include any reusable components used on the page (like <Hero />, <FeatureGrid />, etc.), especially if they consume content.

Why: I can see what content is being rendered and map that to schema fields in config.ts.

3. Any Static Props or GraphQL Queries (if used)
If you’re using getStaticProps, getServerSideProps, or useTina() with GraphQL queries, include those files.

Why: Tina uses GraphQL internally; seeing how you’re already querying data helps match up the schema.

4. Your Current Folder Structure (Overview)
A quick screenshot or copy-paste of your folder tree — especially for content/, pages/, and components/.

Why: Helps determine where Tina should look for your files (e.g., content/pages/home.md vs data/home.json).

🧩 Optional, But Helpful
Any custom content models or JSON structures (e.g. home.json)

Notes on which parts of the site you want to make editable in Tina (e.g. “I want to edit the hero title, image, and the 3 features below the fold”)

📦 Example Ideal File Set to Share
bash
Copy
Edit
/src/pages/Home.tsx
/src/components/Hero.tsx
/content/pages/home.md
/tina/schema or existing tina/config.ts
🚀 Next Step
If you zip and share (or paste the relevant code here), I can:

Draft a complete tina/config.ts with a matching schema

Show you how to bind the content to your components using useTina()

Ensure the Tina sidebar works correctly for your use case

Would you like to paste or upload some code to get started?

Thanks for sharing the project! I found the key files we’ll need to set up TinaCMS (tina/config.ts) for your React site. Here's a summary of what we now have and what’s next.

✅ What You Provided
Your project includes:

React Pages: e.g.

home.tsx (likely your homepage)

conference.tsx, corporate.tsx, education.tsx, etc.

Components: e.g.

header.tsx, footer.tsx, faq.tsx, consultation-modal.tsx

No existing content folder: I didn’t find any .md, .mdx, or .json files in a content/ or data/ folder — which is what Tina requires to power visual editing.

🧱 To Make TinaCMS Work
You’ll need to:

Move page content to content files (optional but recommended)

For example, move homepage text, hero images, FAQ items, etc., into Markdown or JSON files inside a content/ folder.

Define a schema in tina/config.ts

This tells Tina what fields exist and where to find them.

Bind content to your components using useTina()

Or fetch content via Tina’s GraphQL if using static props.

📁 Recommended File Setup
Here’s a simplified example you can follow:

content/pages/home.json
json
Copy
Edit
{
  "hero": {
    "title": "Welcome to Our Site",
    "subtitle": "We build amazing experiences",
    "image": "/images/hero.jpg"
  },
  "faq": [
    {
      "question": "What is this site?",
      "answer": "It's powered by TinaCMS!"
    }
  ]
}
