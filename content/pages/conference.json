    "description": "24 Days Without You was shown in a plenary session at the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Health's national conference in February 2025. It was followed by a panel discussion with Annie's OBGYN, Annie's father, and Annie. AIM also enabled their audience members to submit questions directly to Annie. She answered those questions and spoke at the close of the conference."
